# The Soulmate Statistic

A web scraping tool to accompany my [analysis](#https://towardsdatascience.com/the-soulmate-statistic-63e797e469c9). The tool grabs the scripts of seasons 1 through 3 of the show from Springfield! Springfield! The user can then use my functions to search for key words and return the lines of the show with those words along with annotations for season and episode number.
