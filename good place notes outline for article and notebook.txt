5. [NOTEBOOK]
I got the scripts from the website https://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/ My Jupyter Notebook contains flexible functions to search the scripts for dialogue on any topic. You can use it to do your own investigations if you like. e.g. What is Janet, really? Or, how many points does it really take to get into the Good Place? (I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out. The writers of the show are clever about it.)

Plot of the distribution

6. [STATNOTE] 
Why a one-sample t test with one tail? The distribution isn't 'normal' (bell-shaped,) we don't know the standard deviation, and we don't have separate treatment and control groups.The test would have one tail at the upper bound, the region where the observed mean was so much higher than Sean's guess that there was little chance that the difference in means was due to random chance.

RUN T TEST


7. [stAT NOTE 2]
If the observed mean had hovered somewhere nearer to Sean's mean, the p value might slip above the alpha value and the result would not be significant.)

20. Perfect system:
There are references to the 'perfect system' throughout the show. Most come from Michael, who eventually turns against the system he once espoused. One clear intrepretation of the show is that it critiques our reliance on and faith in systems, algorithms, and numbers.
Season 1, Everything Is Fine
Michael: '...we calculate the total value of your life using our perfectly accurate measuring system. ... Again, it's an incredibly selective system. ... See, that's the trouble with these perfect systems.'

Season 1, Most Improved Player
Michael: 'Our system has never made a mistake before. It's just not possible.'

Season 2, Everything is Great!
Michael: 'Now, normally, our omniscient system perfectly analyzes each person's profile...'

Season 3, 'Janet(s)'
Accountant: 'The system is flawless, and tampering is quite impossible.'
